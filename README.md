# MouthSounds
Python tool for analysing sound files and identifying clicks in speech to allow remediation.

Requirements:
 - Python 3.x
 - Jupyter
 - numpy
 - librosa
 - pandas
 - soundfile

Currently this is only set up to use as a Jupyter notebook. It would be failrly straightforward to convert to a .py file. Has only been tested for use with WAV files, but I suspect it should also work on any librosa supported filetypes.
